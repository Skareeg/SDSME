# SDSME
Source code from Spiky's DS Map Editor

This repository contains the latest source files from Spiky's DS Map Editor, as well as a collection of all the builds released to the public.

Feel free to download these files and edit them! However, please note the following:


-Development of SDSME from my part (Spiky-Eared Pichu) has been halted, so there will be little to no updates to the code from now.

-The code is provided as it was the last time it was edited by me. I began working on version 1.9.0 but never managed to finish the work, so expect crashes, bugs and unfinished features.

-There are many comments throughout the source code, but most of it is pretty messy. I'm sorry.

-SDSME is now open-source software, but before then there were many people who contributed to its development that would certainly appreciate if they were credited in future forks.


Thanks for your understanding, and enjoy! I hope you like it and find the motivation that led me to the creation of this software. Nintendo DS Pokémon hacking needs to keep progressing!
